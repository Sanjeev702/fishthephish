<P> 
    Phishing is a security attack that involves obtaining sensitive or private data by presenting oneself as a trustworthy entity.</br> Phishers often exploit users' trust on the appearance of a site by using web pages that are visually similar to an authentic site.</br>
This paper proposes a phishing detection approach - FISHTHEPHISH - that uses profiles of trusted websites' appearances to detect phishing. </br>Our approach provides similar accuracy to blacklisting approaches, with the advantage that it can classify zero-day phishing attacks and targeted attacks against smaller sites (such as corporate intranets).
